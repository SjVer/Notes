From Wikipedia[^wiki]:

> In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), **procedural generation** (sometimes shortened as **proc-gen**) is a method of creating data [algorithmically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated content and algorithms [...] In video games, it is used to automatically create large amounts of content in a game. Depending on the implementation, advantages of procedural generation can include [...] larger amounts of content, and randomness for less predictable gameplay.

Procedural content generation, or *PCG*, basically means defining a set of rules that a PCG framework uses to, for example, automatically place assets in an environment.

A great example use case would be the generation of forests; instead of having environment artists place each tree by hand PCG can automatically generate endless, realistic tree placements, given a correct ruleset:

Procedural generation can be used for a much wider variety of content, but in video games it is almost exclusively used for the generation of terrain or other surfaces, and placement of premade assets on those surfaces. PCG is also often used for the generation of layouts like dungeons.

## The current State of the Art
There are multiple 'flavours' of procedural generation techniques that are currently being developed and improved[^survey]:

### Pseudo-Random Number Generators
_Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG)_ is one of the oldest and most well-established generation technique. Noise, _L-Systems_ and fractals are used (and often combined) to mimic the randomness found in nature. Commonly, PRNG is used to cheaply generate terrain and textures. 
This technique is also easy to parametrically control using e.g. splines to avoid completely random content, or for artistic control. By itself, there isn't much untapped potential left for this technique, both because of its age and simplicity.

### Generative Grammars
Originally developed in the 1960s for the generation of grammatically correct sentences, _Generative Grammars (GG)_ are sets of rules that operate on individual words. The encoding of elements of an object as letters/words can then yield correct objects/shapes.
There are different types of grammars used for content generation:
- _Lindenmayer-Systems (L-systems)_; grammars consisting of symbols describing the characteristics of an object. A generated sentence/string describes the structure or behaviour of an object.
- _Split Grammars_; grammars similar to L-systems that work on encoded shapes. New shapes are generated by applying shape-to-shape rewriting rules that turn one shape (or more) into another.
- _Wall Grammars_; similar to split grammars, wall grammars are specifically designed to create building exteriors. More advanced rules are used to generate e.g. balconies and fire escapes.
- _Shape Grammars_; due to being context-sensitive and sequential, shape grammars have a more involved rewriting process than L-systems or split grammars, resulting in more complex structures.

In games, this technique is commonly used for generating building exteriors and dungeon layouts. Though this technique is still being applied in novel ways, for example, mixed with machine learning[^gg-ml], the technique itself is at its core not changing much anymore, much like PRNG. 

### Spatial Algorithms
_Spatial Algorithms (SA)_ manipulate a given space to generate game content. The output is generated from a structure like a grid, or using self-recurrence. Examples of spatial algorithms use tiling, layering, grid subdivision, fractals and Voronoi diagrams.
A common use of SA is in tree generation:

The complexity of content generated using SA is of course only limited by the formulas and patterns that can be thought of, but in the context of content generation for games, the core of the technique has not seen much development recently.

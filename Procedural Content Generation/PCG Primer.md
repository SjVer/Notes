From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation):

> In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), **procedural generation** (sometimes shortened as **proc-gen**) is a method of creating data [algorithmically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated content and algorithms [...] In video games, it is used to automatically create large amounts of content in a game. Depending on the implementation, advantages of procedural generation can include [...] larger amounts of content, and randomness for less predictable gameplay.

Procedural content generation, or *PCG*, basically means defining a set of rules that a PCG framework uses to, for example, automatically place assets in an environment.

A great example use case would be the generation of forests; instead of having environment artists place each tree by hand PCG can automatically generate endless, realistic tree placements, given a correct ruleset:

Procedural generation can be used for a much wider variety of content, but in video games it is almost exclusively used for the generation of terrain or other surfaces, and placement of premade assets on those surfaces. PCG is also often used for the generation of layouts like dungeons.

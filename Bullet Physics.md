Bullet Physics is an open-source physics engine that is widely used for simulating rigid body dynamics, soft body dynamics, and collision detection in games and simulations.
## Collision Resolution
Collision resolution refers to the process of determining how objects should respond when they come into contact or collide with each other.

When two objects overlap, the physics engine needs to calculate the forces and impulses acting on these objects to simulate realistic responses such as bouncing, sliding, or toppling. The resolution process involves solving equations to determine how the objects should move and interact based on their physical properties.
## Broadphase
Broadphase is the initial phase of collision detection, where the physics engine quickly identifies potential pairs of objects that may be colliding.

In a simulation with many objects, checking for collisions between every pair of objects can be computationally expensive. Broadphase algorithms aim to reduce this computational cost by quickly excluding pairs of objects that are far away from each other and unlikely to collide. The remaining potential collision pairs are then passed to the narrow phase for more accurate collision detection.
## Narrow Phase
Narrow phase is the stage in collision detection where the potential collision pairs identified in the broadphase are examined more closely to determine whether an actual collision has occurred.

For each potential collision pair, the narrow phase performs precise calculations to check if the objects are indeed colliding. If a collision is detected, the narrow phase provides detailed information about the collision, such as the contact points, normal vectors, and penetration depth. This information is crucial for the subsequent collision resolution step.
## Collision Pairs
Collision pairs refer to pairs of objects in a simulation that are candidates for colliding with each other.

In the broadphase, the physics engine identifies these pairs based on a quick and coarse evaluation of their positions. These potential collision pairs are then passed to the narrow phase for further, more accurate collision checks. If a pair passes the narrow phase tests, it is considered a valid collision pair, and the physics engine proceeds with the collision resolution process to simulate the appropriate physical responses.

In summary, the collision resolution process in Bullet Physics involves identifying potential collision pairs in the broadphase, performing detailed collision checks in the narrow phase, and finally resolving the collisions by calculating appropriate forces and impulses to simulate realistic object interactions.
